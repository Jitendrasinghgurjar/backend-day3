# Day 3 - REST API with Express.js

This is my Day 3 backend project from *Sheryians Coding School, where I learned how to build REST APIs using **Express.js* and handled *POST requests* using req.body.

---

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered

- What are REST APIs?
- HTTP methods: GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE
- Ways to send data in requests:
  - req.body
  - req.query
  - req.params
- Used Postman to test POST routes
- Stored data in memory (array of notes)

---

## ðŸš€ How to Run

```bash
npm install
node server.js
npx nodemon server.js


---

ðŸ“« POST Route Created

Route	Method	Description

/notes	POST	Add a new note (title, description)


Send JSON like this in Postman:

{
  "title": "test_title",
  "description": "test-description"
}

ðŸ“¤ Response:

{
  "message": "note added successfully",
  "notes": [...]
}
